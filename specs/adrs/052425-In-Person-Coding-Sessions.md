# In-person Coding Sessions for Coordination

## Context and Problem Statement

During our sprint retrospective, we realized our remote coordination was insufficient. Team members missed Slack messages, and asynchronous workflows led to confusion and delays. We needed a better way to align on Git workflows and responsibilities given the complexity of the project.

## Decision Drivers

* Increased communication friction when working remotely
* Missed updates and unclear task handoffs
* Need for synchronized Git usage and live troubleshooting
* High complexity of the app architecture

## Considered Options

* Continue remote communication via Slack and GitHub
* Introduce mandatory in-person coding sessions after class

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Introduce mandatory in-person coding sessions after class", because it enables better real-time coordination and minimizes Git conflicts.

### Consequences

* Good, because team members can sync quickly and reduce misunderstandings
* Good, because onboarding to current sprint progress is faster
* Bad, because in-person meetings may not be feasible for everyone consistently

### Confirmation

The team began meeting in person after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting 5/18. Each session includes syncing Git branches, resolving blockers, and orienting on next tasks. Productivity and coordination visibly improved.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Remote communication via Slack

* Good, because it allows for async participation
* Neutral, because Slack keeps records of discussion
* Bad, because important updates are often missed
* Bad, because it's harder to coordinate live Git usage

### In-person coding sessions

* Good, because alignment is immediate
* Good, because it's easier to help each other live
* Bad, because it limits flexibility for those with scheduling conflicts

## More Information

This idea was proposed during the 5/18 sprint retrospective and unanimously supported. It was aimed at reducing friction in coding collaboration and catching everyone up faster.
