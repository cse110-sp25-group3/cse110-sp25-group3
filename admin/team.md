# 303 Found (Team 3)

### Our brand
Our team name is **303 Found**. It's a play on the "404 Not Found" error but since our team number is 3 and we would like to be found, our team was born. In retrospect, it is a bit silly since the actual 303 error is when the original URL cannot be found but who cares. 

### Our values
1. Check the Slack. Please.
2. Finish your assigned work. 
3. Be kind.
