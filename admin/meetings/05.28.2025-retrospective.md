# Sprint Retrospective – May 28, 2025

## Problems
- **Tasks are taking too long to complete**  
  Even though we set deadlines, we’re having trouble meeting them because of other classes and commitments (the midterm).  
  - Sanggeon pointed out that because the quarter is ending, it’s hard for us to work on it simultaneously when we have to study for other stuff.
- **Repetitive bugs**  
  Problems keep coming back because we’re editing on old branches and then merging them without checking.  
  - Yangyang always finds bugs that he already fixed.

## Solutions
- **Set harder deadlines**  
  Decide that at least 80% of the app needs to be completed by Friday.
- **Review pull requests**  
  Actually check our pull requests instead of just merging them immediately.

## Next Steps (By Friday)
- Onboarding needs to be complete.  
- Feed page needs to be finalized.  
- Documents page needs to be finalized.  
- Scraping function will be complete.  
- Autofill feature will be complete.  
- Design should be responsive.
