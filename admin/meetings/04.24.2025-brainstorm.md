# 4/24/2025 Meeting

**Participants:** Daniel, Sanggeon, Yangyang, Aaron, Mehak, Madhav, Yilin, Natalie, Ansh

## 1. New Project Idea: Tinder-Style Job Application App
- **Pros**
  - More complex, looks better on resumes  
  - Less custom UI work compared to Club Penguin  
- **Cons**
  - Requires a lot more backend development  
  - Time-consuming  
  - Could simplify: just send emails instead of full workflow  

**Final decision:** 10–1 in favor of the Tinder-Style Job Application app

## 2. How It Will Work
1. **Data ingestion**  
   - Scrape job listings from LinkedIn & Indeed  
   - Inject into HTML `<div>` cards  
2. **Swipe mechanics**  
   - Swipe right → apply  
   - Swipe left → skip  
3. **Apply flow**  
   - Scrape recruiter info  
   - Send email with user’s uploaded resume  
4. **User setup**  
   - On sign-up: survey + resume PDF upload  
   - Set job preferences  
5. **UI details**  
   - Cards have a front/back  
   - Card-flip animation on entry  

## 3. Team Split
- **Frontend:** Danny, Yangyang, Sanggeon, Aaron, Kelsie, Madhav  
- **Backend:** Mehak, Ansh, Natalie, Yilin, Daniel  

## 4. Action Items
- **Flowchart**: outline code flow & feature dependencies  
- **UI Sketches**: new designs for card interface
