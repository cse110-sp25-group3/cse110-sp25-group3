- **Club Penguin Dojo**: Card game with elements & collection.

## Final Decision
- **Club Penguin Dojo card game replication with customization**

## Gameplay Design
- **Incentives to Collect Cards**  
  - Cards have abilities (e.g., attack power, health).  
  - Winning grants new cards or skins.  
- **Game Flow**  
  1. Players each play 5 cards per match (one per round).  
  2. Compare damage dealt; higher damage wins the round.  
  3. Winner retains opponent’s card.  
  4. Max 5 rounds; if tied, match ends in a draw.  
  5. Retain original Club Penguin win conditions.

## Gameplay Details
- Card values & elemental rules remain unchanged.  
- Skins alter appearance but not stats.  
- Each played card is replaced by drawing a new one.  

## Features
- Card collection & inventory  
- Card dealing mechanic  
- Win/tie conditions  
- Elemental strengths & weaknesses  
- AI opponent logic  
- Achievement system
