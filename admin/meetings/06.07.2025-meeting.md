# Meeting – June 7, 2025

## Fixing Bugs

- Skills scraped from the PDF do not line up with the skills assessment

## Completed Work

- **Ansh** finished the autofill feature → dropdowns work now!  
- **Yangyang** fixed a lot of bugs: duplicate jobs were being added to the View Applications page and were not removed from the feed; no pop-up if no jobs have been applied to yet; added a function to remove a card from the feed from the View Applications page  
- **Natalie** restyled the Feed page and added another Job Preferences menu to it  
- **Daniel** finished writing unit tests for the feed algorithm  

## In Progress

- **Kelsie** needs to do the responsive layout  

## Need to Do

- **Testing** → decided that we’re going to try Selenium automated testing for E2E and then unit tests for functions  

## Work Assignments

- **Natalie** will fix the apply feature on the Feed page (accidentally got deleted)  
- **Natalie and Kelsie** will work on the responsive layout together  
- **Yangyang, Sanggeon, Daniel, Aaron, and Yilin** will do Selenium testing  
- **Ansh** is changing the pretend job application data to real data  
- **Ansh and Madhav** are making an equating parsed skills function
