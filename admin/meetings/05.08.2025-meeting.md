## Answering Questions About the Group Contract

### What are our goals for this project?
- Get a running product, basic but functional  
- Everyone should try out both front-end and back-end  
- Gain experience working in a team (simulate SE after graduation)  

### What are our core values?
- Respect  
- Psychological safety  
- Collaboration: work together and support each other  

### What are our strengths and weaknesses?
- **Strength:** Each member has specific skills in different areas  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Conflicting schedules make communication difficult  
  - Need to update others after meetings via notes  
  - Lack of clear coordination to fully utilize everyone’s skill sets  

### Specific Roles Within Our Team
- Leaning toward splitting by feature branch:  
  - Each person knows the end goal and tasks for their feature  
- Splitting strictly by front/back slowed communication  

## Task Order

### Task 1
- Create mock data for UI reference & build Screens 1–2 (5 people)  
- Search feature + preference filtering (6 people)  

### Task 2
- Data scraping (3 people)  
- Data processing (4 people)  
- Auto-apply feature (4 people)  

### Task 3
- UI for settings (5 people)  
- User authentication (6 people)  

## Competitor Apps
- **Monster:**  
  - Integrates LinkedIn for autofill  
  - Job alerts, career quiz, salary comparisons  
- **SwipeJobs:**  
  - Matches based on recruiter/qualification; opaque matching algorithm  
  - Complaints: no rejection feedback, over-filtering leaves empty feed  
- **Snagajob:**  
  - Lots of listings with filters, no swipe  
  - Complaints: accidental submissions, no undo, repeated listings, bad location filtering  

## Goals for the MVP
- Create a “mindless scroll” UX: swipe to apply or swipe to skip  
- Lower priority on post-application tracking (acceptance/rejection)  
- Emphasize robust filtering with safeguards against over-filtering
