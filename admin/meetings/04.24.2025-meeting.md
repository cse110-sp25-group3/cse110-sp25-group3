## New Project Idea
**Tinder-Style Job Application App**

## Comparison to Club Penguin Idea
**Pros:**  
- More complex, stronger resume impact  
- Less custom UI work (reuse card layouts)  

**Cons:**  
- More backend complexity  
- Time-consuming integration (e.g., Simplify)  
- Could simplify to email-based applications  

## Final Decision
- Vote: 10–1 in favor of Tinder-Style Job Application App

## How It Will Work
1. Scrape job listings from LinkedIn & Indeed  
2. Feed data into HTML cards  
3. Swipe right to apply, left to skip  
4. “Apply” triggers recruiter info scraping + email send with user’s resume  
5. On signup, user completes survey & uploads resume PDF  
6. User sets job preferences  
7. Cards have front/back with flip animation  

## Team Split
- **Frontend:** Danny, Yangyang, Sanggeon, Aaron, Kelsie, Madhav  
- **Backend:** Mehak, Ansh, Natalie, Yilin, Daniel  

## Next Tasks
