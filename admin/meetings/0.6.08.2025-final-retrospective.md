# Sprint Retrospective – June 8, 2025

## How We Worked
- Split into groups based on page or function:  
  - **Yangyang**: View Applications page  
  - **Natalie**: Job Preferences page  
  - **Kelsie, Daniel, Madhav, Yilin, Danny**: Feed page  
  - **Sanggeon, Mehak**: Documents page  
  - **Aaron**: PDF scraping function  
  - **Ansh**: Autofill feature  
- Within each group, we joined Discord calls to collaborate or assign tasks. Communication was mainly isolated to each page; full-group syncs happened in Wednesday meetings (with supplementary check-ins on Tuesdays/Thursdays).  
- Throughout the week, work proceeded on Slack for questions and Discord for screen-sharing. Roles were fluid—Yangyang and Natalie floated between pages as needed.

## Problems over the Course of the Project
- **Deadlines not upheld**  
  Hard deadlines were set but not enforced, leading to repeated setbacks.  
- **Communication gaps**  
  Difficult to have 100% attendance in meetings; we averaged 8–9 of 11 members.  
- **Task granularity**  
  Tasks were designated by page, but lacked specificity per person.  
- **Code overwrites**  
  Natalie committed directly to `main` instead of feature branches, causing merge conflicts.

## Successes
- **Group chemistry**  
  High trust in teammates to complete designated tasks.  
- **Small-group focus**  
  Isolated sub-teams (2–4 people) reduced coordination overhead versus full-team.  
- **Effective collaboration**  
  Real-time Discord coding/debugging allowed context-rich problem solving and faster fixes.
