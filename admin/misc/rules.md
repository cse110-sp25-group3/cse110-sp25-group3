# Team Charter

## 1. Team Purpose and Objectives

### Purpose
To collaboratively design and develop a job application platform that simplifies the job-hunting experience through a swipe-based interface. The product will allow users to easily browse and apply for jobs, with a focus on simplicity and speed.

### Objectives
- Build a **minimum viable product (MVP)** that is functional and user-friendly.
- Ensure **all team members** contribute to both **frontend and backend** to gain full-stack experience.
- Practice **team-based software development** to prepare for real-world engineering roles post-graduation.
- Design filtering and job recommendation logic that accounts for **edge cases and avoids overfiltering**.
- Mimic the intuitive experience of popular apps by making **job applications as simple as swiping**.

## 2. Common Values and Standards

### Core Values
- **Respect:** Every voice is heard and valued.
- **Psychological Safety:** Safe space to share ideas, ask questions, and make mistakes.
- **Collaboration:** We prioritize teamwork and shared success over individual glory.
- **Transparency:** Decisions and updates are clearly communicated.

### Team Standards
- Come prepared to meetings.
- Stay engaged with your assigned feature or task.
- Use shared tools consistently (e.g., Git, meeting notes, Slack/Discord).
- Submit updates or blockers before each meeting, even if you cannot attend.

## 3. Roles, Responsibilities, and Accountability

### Structure
- **Feature-Based Teams:** Each member works on a defined feature (e.g., filtering, UI, auto-apply).
- **Shared Responsibilities:** Everyone touches both frontend and backend code as needed.

### Roles (rotating or shared as necessary)
- **Project Lead:** Coordinates task delegation, sets meeting agendas, oversees progress.
- **Tech Lead(s):** Ensures code quality, advises on technical decisions, handles merges and pull requests.
- **Scrum Master (optional):** Keeps meetings on track and ensures blockers are addressed.
- **Note-Taker/Communicator:** Records meeting notes and shares summaries with the team.

### Accountability
- Tasks must be completed by the deadline unless communicated otherwise.
- If a task is delayed, notify the group proactively and propose a plan to catch up.
- Team members should **review each other’s code** to ensure knowledge sharing and maintain quality.

## 4. Conflict-Resolution Strategies

### Potential Issues
- Miscommunication due to conflicting schedules.
- Unclear ownership of tasks or responsibilities.
- Disagreements on implementation choices.
- Uneven workload distribution.

### Conflict-Resolution Approach
1. **Address Privately First:** Individuals involved discuss the issue one-on-one.
2. **Bring to Group:** If unresolved, raise in a team meeting for collaborative resolution.
3. **Mediation:** If needed, a neutral team member (or TA/instructor if applicable) mediates.
4. **Actionable Steps:** Define concrete actions to resolve the issue and avoid recurrence.

## 5. Addressing Rule Violations

If someone is not following agreed-upon expectations (e.g., missing updates, not contributing):

- Step 1: Have a direct, respectful conversation with the individual.
- Step 2: If the issue persists, raise it with the team and define consequences (e.g., reassignment of tasks).
- Step 3: Escalate if necessary (to TA, instructor, or mentor if part of a course).

Everyone is expected to hold each other accountable in a constructive and supportive way.

## 6. Communication Protocols

### Tools
- **GitHub** for version control and issue tracking.
- **Slack/Discord** for daily communication.
- **Google Docs** for meeting notes and planning.

### Protocols
- Share daily or weekly updates, especially if you are blocked or will miss a deadline.
- Meeting notes should be shared in a central location after every meeting.
- Questions should be asked early rather than waiting — someone else may have the same one.

## Task Overview

### Task 1
- **Mock data + UI for Screens 1 and 2** (5 ppl)
- **Search and filtering by preference** (6 ppl)

### Task 2
- **Data scraping** (3 ppl)
- **Data processing** (4 ppl)
- **Auto-apply functionality** (4 ppl)

### Task 3
- **UI for settings** (5 ppl)
- **User authentication** (6 ppl)

---

## Competitor Insights Summary

- **Monster**: Strong LinkedIn integration, job alerts, and career tools.
- **swipejobs**: Match-based, lacks rejection feedback, often overfilters.
- **Snagajob**: Filter-heavy, no swipe interface, repetitive listings and poor location matching.

### Key Takeaways for Our MVP
- Focus on a **swipe-to-apply** experience with low friction.
- Prioritize **effective filtering** and **user-friendly UI**.
- Deprioritize post-application tracking (due to technical constraints).
- Use feedback from competitor shortcomings to guide feature prioritization.

## Final Notes

This team charter is a living document. It should be revisited and adjusted as the project evolves.
