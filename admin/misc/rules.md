# Group Contract

## Goals
- Develop a basic but functional running product.
- Ensure all team members gain experience with both frontend and backend development.
- Learn what it's like to work in a team coding environment, mimicking post-graduation software engineering scenarios.

## Core Values
- **Respect** for one another’s input and time.
- **Psychological safety** to share ideas and ask questions freely.
- **Team collaboration** as a learning goal — we’re all here to gain experience working in teams, so cooperation is key.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths
- Team members possess diverse skills across various technical areas.

### Weaknesses
- **Scheduling Conflicts:** Difficult communication due to conflicting schedules.
  - **Action:** Use meeting notes to keep everyone updated.
- **Lack of Coordination:** Uncertainty around how to best utilize everyone’s skills.
  - **Action:** Reference course suggestions for team organization and task delegation.

## Team Organization

- Leaning toward **feature-based roles**.
  - Members working on a specific feature will have clear goals and tasks.
  - Splitting frontend and backend tasks separately has led to delays and miscommunication.

# MVP Goals

- Deliver a **mindless scroll** user experience:  
  Just **swipe to apply** or **swipe to dismiss**.
- Minimal emphasis on post-application tracking:
  - We likely won't be able to track rejection or acceptance (especially via email).
  - Can include links to external application sites.
- Focus heavily on the **filtering system**:
  - Address edge cases
  - Build safeguards to prevent overfiltering
